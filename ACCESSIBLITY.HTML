<p style="text-align: center;">any Internet users with disabilities find web sites difficult or even impossible to use simply because of the way they are designed. We are working hard at Mondelez UK to provide access to information that is available to all our customers, and this goes for the website, too. We are aware of the types of adaptive technology used by people with disabilities and are redesigning pages across our portfolio of websites to ensure compatibility with as many of these systems as possible. Changes include keeping text clear, formatting layouts and tables, and making sure links adequately describe where they go. We are rebuilding our websites to meet the Wed Accessibility Initiative (WAI) Content Accessibility Guidelines set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and we aim, wherever possible, to ensure we confirm to ‘Double-A’ standards. You can find out more about the initiative on W3C's website. If you come across a part of our site that is difficult to use please tell us about it. We intend to keep improving our accessibility – so to help us do it, send us your comments.
