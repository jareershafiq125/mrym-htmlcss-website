      Human Rights Due Diligence and Modern Slavery Reporting
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      The Human Rights Due Diligence and Modern Slavery report is part of our
      ongoing evaluation and review of best practices in enhancing its approach
      to respecting human rights. To identify human rights risk, we are
      committed to undertaking practical, proactive due diligence in our owned
      operations and seek to work with suppliers who share the same level of
      commitment. We take action to mitigate identified risks, prioritize areas
      of focus through signature sustainable sourcing programs, and advocate for
      systemic solutions through public-private collaboration.
